# Table Tennis Tournament Generator App

This is my version of the technical challenge set by DevelopMe at the end of their Coding Fellowship.

The project is a React app specifically designed for generating tournaments of 4, 8, or 16 players.

A live version of the app can be found at - http://sam.maggs.developme.training/

## Getting Started

Required: yarn, command line
1. Clone this repo: in the command line run ```git clone git@github.com:sammaggs/ping-pong-app.git```
2. Navigate into ping-pong-app
3. Run ```yarn install```
4. Run ```yarn start```

The app should now start up in your browser :)
