# Table Tennis Tournament Generator App

This is my version of the technical challenge set by DevelopMe at the end of their Coding Fellowship.

The project is a React app specifically designed for generating tournaments of 4, 8, or 16 players (can be increased easily).

A live version of the app can be found at - http://samm.developme.space/tabletennis

## Planning 

Several Wireframes were completed using Quirk Tools. 

Other planning was done to think about the logic that would be needed, and how to attack that from the start.

Logic such as:

- Shuffling of players to make random matches
- Splitting players into pairs to create matches
- Recording winners to send them into the following round
- Auto generating next round once previous round had finished
- Finally, ending up with 1 player as the tournament winner

These things have been successfully implemented and can be viewed in the app.


## Getting Started

If you wish to run the app on your own machine please do the following:
Required: yarn, command line
1. Clone this repo: in the command line run ```git clone git@github.com:sammaggs/ping-pong-app.git```
2. Navigate/cd into ping-pong-app
3. Run ```yarn install```
4. Run ```yarn start```

The app should now start up in your browser :)
